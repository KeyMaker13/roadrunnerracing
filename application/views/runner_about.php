		About UTSA Roadrunner Racing 
	</p>
<p>
Formula SAE is an international collegiate design competition
that challenges students to con­ceive, design, fabricate and race a
small formula-style race car. Over 250 teams from around the
world compete in at least one of the eight com­petitions which are
held in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy,
Brazil, Australia, and Japan. There are very few restrictions
on the design of the car, allowing students to express their
knowledge, creativity, and imagination.
The cars are judged
in both static and dynamic events, which evaluate them in
categories such as handling, performance, braking, endurance,
manufacturability, design decision making process, cost, and market
strategy. In addition to competing in a world-class
competition, dedi­cated young engineers gain valuable experience on
the most relevant, team-oriented engineer­ing project available to
students. UTSA’s interdisciplinary team includes mechanical
engineers, graphic design artist, and MBAs.

Dynamic Events 
</p>

<div class='infobox-smmd--width-stretch textpadding' >
<p class='underline'>Skid Pad: (5%)</p>
<p>
This event tests the cornering capability of the racecar.
  The car must travel around a figure-eight formation as 
 fast as possible without knocking over any of the cones 
 that outline the course.
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class='infobox-sm-width-stretch textpadding' >
<p class='underline'>
Acceleration: (7.5%)
</p>

<p>
This event tests the ability for the vehicle to accelerate
from rest over a 250-foot distance.  The fastest out of 
four runs is recorded.
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class='infobox-smmd-width-stretch textpadding' >
<p class='underline'>
Autocross: (15%)
</p>
<p>
After being allowed to walk the course for a set amount of
 time, drivers must maneuver the car through the tight
 turns and slaloms.  Any cones knocked over count as
 penalties.  Each team is granted four attempts, of which
 the fastest lap time is recorded.
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class='infobox-md-width-stretch textpadding' >
<p class='underline'>
Endurance/Fuel Economy: (40%)
</p>
<p>
This brutal 22 kilometer race tests the limits of both car 
and driver.  There is one mandatory stop for a driver 
change at the halfway point.  Fuel economy is calculated and 
compared with other cars at the finish.  Only cars that cross 
the finish line can score any points.

Static Events 
</p>

<div class='infobox-smmd-wide-stretch textpadding' >
<p class='underline'>
Business Presentation: (7.5%)
</p> 
<p>
This event evaluates the team’s ability to deliver a quality 
technical sales presentation.  The car must be marketed to a 
hypothetical manufacturing firm planning to produce four cars
per day for a limited production run.  The intend­ed target
market is the amateur weekend autocross racer.
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class='infobox-smmd-wide-stretch textpadding' >
<p class='underline'>Cost Analysis: (10%)
</p>
<p>
Teams must submit a report detailing the total proto­type cost 
of the vehicle and capital expenditures (plants, machinery, and
tools) for a limited production run by a hypothetical manufacturing 
firm.  The total cost of the vehicle must not exceed $25,000
</p>

<br>

<div class='infobox-smmd-wide-stretch textpadding' >
<p class='underline'>
Engineering Design: (15%)
</p>
<p>
This event rates the quality of engineering design used in the 
development of the race car.  Judges evaluate the team’s innovative
ideas as well as test the reasoning and theory behind the design.
  During this event, vehicle test data and analysis are also scrutinized.
